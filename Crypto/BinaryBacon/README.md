# Binary Bacon

## Solution

First part of challenge is to get the letters specified in the BINARY.txt first number is the row, second number is the column.

After getting the letters we just need to convert it into binary, uppercase is 1 and lowercase is 0. Converting the binary to ascii we get GCTF{b1n4ryb4c0n_ciph3r\_15\_z3\_b3st_ciph3r\_4_u}.
